        <p>I fancy CSS, animating divs, reusable components, turning mockups into markup,and am pretty into Gatsby.js right now.</p>
        <p>Other likes are my doggos, drumming, vinyl, hiking, camping, biking, yoga, card games and possibly too much Netflix.</p>
        <p>I am currently employed at SportsEngine working mostly in JS, SCSS, Drupal and PHP. </p>
        <p>Have something to share? Iâ€™d love to hear from you. Reach out here. Thank you for visiting. Stay funky and watch out for cyclists.</p>
